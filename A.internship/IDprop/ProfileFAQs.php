							However, only a Tenant has the right to grant data access to his/her profile, regardless of whether the Letting Agent/Landlord 
							are willing to pay for such access.

							&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>How do you align "Data Privacy", required by GDPR, with Cyber Security?</span>
						</section>
						<section class="draw">
							As Cyber Attacks become increasingly sophisticated, this places additional burdens on corporations to protect 
							client data and avoid GDPR breaches. We have taken numerous precautions: 
							<br><br>(i) Multiple layers of in-built security at the application and network levels 
							<br><br>(ii) Key-Based 2-Factor Authentication (2FA): the PIN is neither transmitted nor stored. It fails after a few 
							incorrect attempts and the PIN is entered on a keypad so even a keylogger could not view the PIN 
							<br><br>(iii) All uploads, downloads and stored data are encrypted with state-of-the-art encryption algorithms. 
							In other words, in the worst-case scenario, were a Data Leak to occur (due to malicious hackers), they would access encrypted data, 
							which cannot be cracked easily or quickly - the most likely scenario is hackers would move on to easier prey
